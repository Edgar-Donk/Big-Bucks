Horizontal spacing

By default, the theme's three columns have fixed widths. The primary sidebar will snap to the left, the 
secondary sidebar will snap to the right, and the article content will be centered in between.

    If one of the sidebars is not present, then the article content will be centered between the other 
	sidebar and the side of the page.
    If neither sidebar is present, the article content will be in the middle of the page.

If you'd like the article content to take up more width than its default, use the max-width CSS property 
with the following selectors:

.bd-main .bd-content .bd-article-container {
  max-width: 100%;  /* default is 60em */
}

The above rule will set the article content max width to the same width as the top navigation bar. To 
truly use all of the available page width, you also need to set the following CSS rule:

.bd-page-width {
  max-width: 100%;  /* default is 88rem */
}

This will affect both the article content and the top navigation bar.

Note

If you use both of the custom CSS rules above, be sure to keep them as separate rules in your CSS file. 
If you combine them, the result will be a CSS selector that is less specific than the two default rules 
in the theme, and your custom CSS will fail to override the theme defaults.

to make css file work ensure have valid css directory and valid config.py
where the css file is

html_static_path = ['_static']
html_css_files = [
    'css/custom.css',
]

.bd-sidebar-primary {
	width: 20%;
}

.bd-sidebar-secondary {
	width: 15%;
}

left (primary) was 31%
right 26%
main 48%

--> 20% 65% 15%
