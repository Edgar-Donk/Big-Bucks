Bucks documentation
===================

Are you struggling with larger dataframes, then you can switch to *Polars* 
which has a python interface but runs on rust - this can take larger dataframes
in its stride. If you have a system based on pandas then the methods will need
updating. There follows an example based on polars loading the Starbucks Location
dataframe - after aggregating the dataset display as maps with altair.
